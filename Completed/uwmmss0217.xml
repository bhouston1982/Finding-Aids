      <p>While researching his dissertation on African American school reform and activism from the
        1930s to the 1990s in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Jack Dougherty conducted over sixty-five oral
        history interviews. Most were recorded during the summers of 1995 and 1996, and transcribed
        within the following year or two. Portions of these stories were included in his book,
          <title render="italic">More Than One Struggle: The Evolution of Black School Reform in
          Milwaukee</title>.</p>
      <p>The oral history project sought to interview and document African Americans who engaged in
        one or more K-12 school reform movements from the 1930s to the 1990s. Interviewees included
        individuals who represented different perspectives on the school reform movement due to
        gender or position within the organization (leading spokesperson versus ordinary
        participants). Detailed information about Dougherty's interview process, the impact of these
        interviews on his writing, and similar matters is contained in series 2, in a folder titled
        "Project Background." This folder also contains detailed information about topics discussed
        in each interview.</p>
      <p>Although the interviews played a significant role in shaping Dougherty's understanding of
        African American school reform and activism, excerpts from the interviews appear
        infrequently in the published work. Thus the collection contains a wealth of information to
        support original research into and writing about this topic.</p>
